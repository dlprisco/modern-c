# Modern c++ real-world problems repository


## Overview

&nbsp; This repo is a collection of 100 real-world problems designed for practice a large variety of the c++  language and standard libary features.

&nbsp; Generally, these asignments could be solved in many pogramming language (Java, C, lisp, etc.). Of course, the intention is to help programmers community master Python and therefore you are expected to solve them in Python. All the solutions provided in each problem file. However, you can use them as you might solve with your own solution and you can use as reference for its collection of proposed problems.


## Organization
&nbsp; The problems in this repo are grouped into 12 section. Each section contains problems on similiar or related topics. The problems have differents levels of difficulty; some of them are easy, some moderate and some difficult. 

&nbsp;  At the time of figure out this programs, the 3.9 Python version es usada abiertamente y comprobada que funciona para los archivos y lo será por un largo tiempo.

#### Learning 
&nbps; If you are interested en aprender este lenguaje en profundidad, estos problemas pueden ayudarte mucho si intentas resolver los problemas práctivos que son planteados aquí

## Sections
&nbsp; **Section 1**, *Math Problems*: contiene una serie de ejercicios matemáticos para calentar hacia una introducción a los problemas de las siguientes secciones.

&nbsp; **Section 2**, *Language features*: probelmas propuestos a practicar como operadores overloading, clases funciones

&nbsp; **Section 3**, *String and Regular Expressions*: Has serveral problems for string manipulation, such as converting between strings and other data types, splitting and joining strings, and also for working with regex.

&nbsp; **Section 4**, *Streams and Filesystems*: Covers output stream manipulation and working with files and directories using python os module

&nbsp; **Section 5**, *Date and Time*: prepares you for the upcoming C++20 extensions to the chrono
library, with several calendar and time zone problems that you can solve with the date
library, on which the new standard additions are based.

&nbsp; **Section 6**, *Algorithms and Data Structures*: Is one of the largest chapters and contains a
variety of problems; The chapter ends with two rather fun problems,
Dawkins' Weasel program and Conway's Game of Life program, where you can learn
about evolutionary algorithms and cellular automata
 
&nbsp; **Section 7**, *Concurrency*: is where we use threads and asynchronous functions to implement
general-purpose parallel algorithms, but also solve some real-word problems involving
concurrency.


&nbsp; **Section 8**, *Design Patterns*: proposes a series of problems suited to be solved with design
patterns such as decorator, composite, chain of responsibility, template method, and others.


&nbsp; **Section 9**, *Data Serialization*: Serialization, covers most common formats of serialized data, JSON, and
XML, with several problems; but it also challenges you to create PDF files, all with the use
of third-party, open-source, and cross-platform libraries


&nbsp; **Section 10**, *Archives, Images, and Databases*: Teaches you to solve problems for working with
zip archives, creating PNG files for real-world problems, such as Captcha-like systems and
barcodes, and embedding and utilizing SQLite databases in your applications.


&nbsp; **Section 10**, *Cryptography*: Mostly covers the user of the Crypto++ library for data
encryption and signing. It also challenges you to implement your own Base64 encoding and
decoding utilities.


&nbsp; **Section 10**, *Networking and Services*: Is where you have to implement your own clientserver
application communicating on TCP/IP, and also consume various REST services
such as bitcoin exchange rates or text translation APIs.
