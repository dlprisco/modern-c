# Modern C++ real-world problems 


## Overview

&nbsp; This repo is a collection of real-world problems designed for practice a large variety of the *C++* language and standard libary features.

&nbsp; Generally these assignments could be solved in many pogramming language (Java, Python, lisp, etc.). Of course, the intention is to help programmers community master *C ++* and therefore you are expected to solve them in  *C* or *C++*. All the solutions provided in each problem file. However, you can use them as you might solve with your own solution and you can use as reference for its collection of proposed problems.

# Challenges
&nbsp; The problems in this repo are grouped into different sections. Each section contains problems on similiar or related topics. The problems have different levels of difficulty; some of them are easy, some moderate and some difficult.

## [**Section 1**](https://github.com/ms768/modern-c-/tree/main/Math%20problems)
**Math Problems**: contains a series of mathematical exercises to warm up towards an introduction to the problems in the following sections.

## [**Section 2**](https://github.com/ms768/modern-c-/tree/main/Language%20features)
**Language features**: problems proposed to practice as overloading operators, function, classes.

## [**Section 3**](https://github.com/ms768/modern-c-/tree/main/Date%20and%20Time) 
**Date and Time**: prepares you for the upcoming C ++ 20 extensions to the chrono
library, with several calendar and time zone problems that you can solve with the date
library, on which the new standard additions are based.
