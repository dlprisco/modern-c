# Modern C++ real-world problems 


## Overview

&nbsp; This repo is a collection of real-world problems designed for practice a large variety of the *C++* language and standard libary features.

&nbsp; Generally these assignments could be solved in many pogramming language (Java, Python, lisp, etc.). Of course, the intention is to help programmers community master *C ++* and therefore you are expected to solve them in  *C* or *C++*. All the solutions provided in each problem file. However, you can use them as you might solve with your own solution and you can use as reference for its collection of proposed problems.

# Challenges
&nbsp; The problems in this repo are grouped into different sections. Each section contains problems on similiar or related topics. The problems have different levels of difficulty; some of them are easy, some moderate and some difficult. At time of figure out this programs, the c ++ 17 or c ++ 20 version is openly used and proven to work for files and will be for a long time.

## [**Section 1**](https://github.com/ms768/modern-c-/tree/main/Math%20problems)
**Math Problems**: contains a series of mathematical exercises to warm up towards an introduction to the problems in the following sections.

## [**Section 2**](https://github.com/ms768/modern-c-/tree/main/Language%20features)
**Language features**: problems proposed to practice as overloading operators, function, classes.

## [**Section 3**](https://github.com/ms768/modern-c-/tree/main/Strings%20and%20Regular%20Expressions)
**String and Regular Expressions**: Has serveral problems for string manipulation, such as converting between strings and other data types, splitting and joining strings, and also for working with regex.

## [**Section 4**](https://github.com/ms768/modern-c-/tree/main/Streams%20and%20filesystem)
**Streams and Filesystems**: Covers output stream manipulation and working with files and directories using python os module.

## [**Section 5**](https://github.com/ms768/modern-c-/tree/main/Date%20and%20Time) 
**Date and Time**: prepares you for the upcoming C ++ 20 extensions to the chrono
library, with several calendar and time zone problems that you can solve with the date
library, on which the new standard additions are based.

## [**Section 6**](https://github.com/ms768/modern-c-/tree/main/Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures)
**Algorithms and Data Structures**: Is one of the largest chapters and contains a
variety of problems; The chapter ends with two rather fun problems,
Dawkins' Weasel program and Conway's Game of Life program, where you can learn
about evolutionary algorithms and cellular automata.

## [**Section 7**](https://github.com/ms768/modern-c-/tree/main/Concurrency)
**Concurrency**: Is where we use threads and asynchronous functions to implement
general-purpose parallel algorithms, but also solve some real-word problems involving
concurrency.
