// Prime factors of a number.

/*

  	  The prime factors of a positive integer are the prime numbers that divide that integer
    exactly. For instance, the prime factors of 8 are 2 x 2 x 2, and the prime factors of 42 are 2 x 3
    x 7. To determine the prime factors you should use the following algorithm:

		1. While n is divisible by 2, 2 is a prime factor and must be added to the list,
		while n becomes the result of n/2. After completing this step, n is an odd
		number.

		2. Iterate from 3 to the square root of n. While the current number, letâ€™s call it i,
		divides n, i is a prime factor and must be added to the list, while n becomes the
		result of n/i. When i no longer divides n, increment i by 2 (to get the next odd
		number).

		3. When n is a prime number greater than 2, the steps above will not result
		in n becoming 1. Therefore, if at the end of step 2 n is still greater than 2, then n is
		a prime factor.
