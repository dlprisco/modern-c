// Abundant numbers.

/*
	
     An abundant number, also known as an excessive number, is a number for which the sum
  of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. The proper divisors of a number are
  the positive prime factors of the number, other than the number itself. The amount by
  which the sum of proper divisors exceeds the number itself is called abundance. For
  instance, the number 12 has the proper divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Their sum is 16, which
  makes 12 an abundant number. Its abundance is 4 (that is, 16 - 12).

	  To determine the sum of proper divisors, we try all numbers from 2 to the square root of
  the number (all prime factors are less than or equal to this value). If the current number,
  letâ€™s call it i, divides the number, then i and num/i are both divisors. However, if they are
  equal (for example, if i = 3, and n = 9, then i divides 9, but n/i = 3), we add
  only i because proper divisors must only be added once. Otherwise, we add
  both i and num/i and continue:

		}
	}
	return result
