## Problems


**32. Pascal's triangle**
Write a function that prints up to 10 rows of Pascal's triangle to the console.


**33. Tabular printing of a list of processes**
Suppose you have a snapshot of the list of all processes in a system. The information for each process includes name, identifier, status (which can be either running or suspended), account name (under which the process runs), memory size in bytes, and platform (which can be either 32-bit or 64-bit). Your task is to write a function that takes such a list of processes and prints them to the console alphabetically, in tabular format. All columns must be left-aligned, except for the memory column which must be right-aligned. The value of the memory size must be displayed in KB. The following is an example of the output of this function:

```

chrome.exe 	     1044    Running      marius.bancila    25180     32-bit
chrome.exe       10100   Running      marius.bancila    227756    32-bit
cmd.exe          512     Running      SYSTEM            48 		  64-bit
explorer.exe     7108    Running      marius.bancila    29529 	  64-bit
skype.exe        22456   Suspended    marius.bancila    656       64-bit

```

**34. Removing empty lines from a text file**
Write a program that, given the path to a text file, modifies the file by removing all empty lines. Lines containing only whitespaces are considered empty.

**35. Computing the size of a directory**
Write a function that computes the size of a directory, in bytes, recursively. It should be possible to indicate whether symbolic links should be followed or not.

**36. Deleting files older than a given date**
Write a function that, given the path to a directory and a duration, deletes all the entries (files or subdirectories) older than the specified duration, in a recursive manner. The duration can represent anything, such as days, hours, minutes, seconds, and so on, or a combination of that, such as one hour and twenty minutes. If the specified directory is itself older than the given duration, it should be deleted entirely.

**37. Finding files in a directory that match a
regular expression**
Write a function that, given the path to a directory and a regular expression, returns a list of all the directory entries whose names match the regular expression.

**38. Temporary log files**
Create a logging class that writes text messages to a discardable text file. The text file should have a unique name and must be located in a temporary directory. Unless specified otherwise, this log file should be deleted when the instance of the class is destroyed. However, it should be possible to retain the log file by moving it to a permanent location.
